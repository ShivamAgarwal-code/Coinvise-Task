NFT Membership Marketplace

## The Assignment

Your task is to develop an NFT memberships marketplace, facilitating creators in minting and listing NFT memberships that unlock various benefits for buyers. In this marketplace:

- Creators can create and list NFTs, each with specific benefits
- Buyers can explore and purchase these NFT memberships based on their interests

You have the freedom to design the core functionalities, UI/UX elements, and overall structure of the application as you see fit.

**Remember, buyers are the primary users of this application. Ensure all information is easily accessible and understandable for them.**

*Note: We use the word “membership” here loosely. This does not have to be a recurring purchase, one time purchase is fine.*

### Key Requirements

- Develop an intuitive and engaging UI/UX for both creators and buyers. Ensure the design is responsive, accessible, and easy to navigate
- The create form should have all the fields necessary to create an NFT membership. Examples are title, symbol, image, price etc. (*Not an exhaustive list*)
    - Creators should be able to add one or more benefits for their membership
- Make it easy for buyers to explore, evaluate, and purchase memberships
- Choose an appropriate backend framework and database to store relevant information
- Try and incorporate the latest features these Frameworks have to offer, showcase your skills and in the meanwhile help us understand how well versed you are with the developments happening in the frontend space
- Show approximate USD price for creators
- Document your codebase and the choices you made during development and clear usage instructions
- Feel free to use any UI library like Shadcn UI, Chakra UI, etc. (but make sure you can justify the reasoning behind it – for example using something like MUI and customising the complete component design won't make sense)
- We prefer using TailwindCSS, but any styling solution is welcome. Just make sure to have your reasons to accompany the usage.
- Please deploy your code on Vercel or Netlify where we can see the demo
- Feel free to build on top of smart contracts by [OpenZeppelin](https://www.openzeppelin.com/) to save time. The application should be deployed on a testnet of a famous EVM chain (We prefer Ethereum or Polygon)
